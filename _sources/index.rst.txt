Light Curve Fitting Documentation
=================================

This package contains tools to fit analytical models to multiband light curves of astronomical transients.

For a quick guide to get started, see the included `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/griffin-h/lightcurve_fitting/blob/master/lightcurve_fitting.ipynb>`_.

The documentation is a bit sparse right now, but feel free to contact the author for help.

If you use this code in a publication, please **cite the original papers** whose models you used, as well as my Zenodo repository.
